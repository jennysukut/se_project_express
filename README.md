# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Welcome! This is the Back-End Project focused on creating a server for my WTWR application. In the project, I've used made Schema Models, and connected them to Controllers + Routes to process requests and errors as necessary. Currently, we have a collection of users, clothing items, and likes we are able to keep track of with this SQL database.

The eventual goal of this project is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
