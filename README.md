# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Welcome! This is the Back-End Project focused on creating a server for my WTWR application. In the project, I've used made Schema Models, and connected them to Controllers + Routes to process requests and errors as necessary. Currently, we have a collection of users, clothing items, and likes we are able to keep track of with this SQL database. We have created a server and use API calls along with user authorization middlewares to access information and keep our data secure.
